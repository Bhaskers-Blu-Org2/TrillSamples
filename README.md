# Introduction

This repository hosts samples that demonstrate how to use Trill.

# What is Trill

Trill is a high-performance one-pass in-memory streaming analytics engine from Microsoft Research. It can handle both real-time and offline data, and is based on a temporal data and query model. Trill can be used as a streaming engine, a lightweight in-memory relational engine, and as a progressive query processor (for early query results on partial data). We have a non-commercial evaluation version of Trill available publicly, via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Trill/).


# Getting Started

The samples right here are a great way to start, they will download the Trill binaries for you via NuGet.
